            <h2>✨ Who Am I?</h2>
            <p> Hi, I’m Velaphi Thamsanqa Nkosi — a passionate innovator, data enthusiast, and purpose-driven problem solver. I hold a Postgraduate Diploma in Science, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship (with Distinction) and I’m currently pursuing a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences, with certifications in Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Sustainability, and Computer Science.

                My journey blends science, technology, and community development. I believe in using data and innovation not just to solve problems, but to change lives. From developing intelligent queue systems to building Bitcoin prediction models, I bring practical solutions to real-world challenges.

                Beyond the code, I’m deeply involved in volunteer work, community outreach, and urban upliftment. My long-term goal is to urbanize underdeveloped areas, create sustainable infrastructure, and use technology to empower communities across Africa and the world.

                This site is a window into my work, my values, and the future I’m building—one line of code, one idea, one action at a time.</p>
